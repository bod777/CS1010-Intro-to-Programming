Write a program to produce the lyrics (all 12 verses) of the Twelve Days of Christmas. This is a cumulative song as each verse is build on top of the previous verses.  You must

have a loop for the verses,
build up each of the verses within a loop (or switch statement),
use at least one switch statement in your solution,
only write the lines of text (or constants representing them) from the song once in your program (e.g. you cannot have more than one statement in the entire program which prints out "my true love sent to me")... 
Sample output.

On the first day of Christmas
my true love sent to me:
a Partridge in a Pear Tree. 
On the second day of Christmas
my true love sent to me:
2 Turtle Doves
and a Partridge in a Pear Tree. 
On the third day of Christmas
my true love sent to me:
3 French Hens,
2 Turtle Doves
and a Partridge in a Pear Tree
 ...
Just before you submit your program you need to do a self-assessment exercise to evaluate how well you did...
Copy the multi line comment below and put it at the top of your program. Put in a mark and a comment for each criterion (even if you have given yourself full marks, otherwise one mark will be deducted per criterion that is missing this information).
/* SELF ASSESSMENT
   1. Did I use appropriate CONSTANTS instead of numbers within the code?
       Mark out of 5:
   2. Did I use easy-to-understand, meaningful CONSTANT names formatted correctly in UPPERCASE?
       Mark out of 5:
   3. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names formatted properly (in lowerCamelCase)?
       Mark out of 10:
   4. Did I indent the code appropriately?
       Mark out of 10:
   5. Did I use an appropriate loop (or loops) to produce the different verses?
       Mark out of 20: 
   6. Did I use a switch to build up the verses?
       Mark out of 25: 
   7. Did I avoid duplication of code and of the lines which make up the verses (each line should be referred to in the code only once (or twice))?
       Mark out of 10: 
   8. Does the program produce the correct output?
       Mark out of 10: 
   9. How well did I complete this self-assessment?
       Mark out of 5:
   Total Mark out of 100 (Add all the previous marks):
