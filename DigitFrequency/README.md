Michaelmas Week 12
1D and 2D Arrays
Example Code

Write a program which determines the frequency of digits.  The user is allowed to repeatedly enter integers and the program determines how many times each digit has appeared.  For example:
  Enter a number> 155
  Digit frequencies:  1(1) 5(2)
  Enter a number> 5215
  Digit frequencies:  1(2) 2(1) 5(4)
  Enter a number>

As part of your solution you must write and use the following routines:
  - printDigitFrequencies() which takes an array containing the frequencies and prints out the frequencies to System.out (but only for the  digits which have occurred).
  - countDigitFrequencies() which takes a number and an array of frequencies and updates the array of frequencies depending on the letter which appear in the number.
