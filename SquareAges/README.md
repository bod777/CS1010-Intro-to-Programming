The mathematician Augustus De Morgan was aged 43 in the year 1849AD.  This is interesting because 43 squared is 1849, ie, in 1849 his age was the square root of the year.
Given that no person has ever lived longer than 123 years (and assuming that no one ever will), write a Java application that will determine if it is possible that anyone who is alive today is, has ever been, or will ever be alive in a year that is the square of their age.
If it is possible, your program should print out the years in which it happens and the ages that the people concerned will have in those years.
Note: This question is Q.1 from the CS1011 exam paper in May 2010
Hint: It is strongly recommended that you first write a program which writes out the square of each possible age (from 0 to 123).  Then you can adapt this program and restrict the output to those which ages and years satisfy the question...
Just before you submit your program you need to do a self-assessment exercise to evaluate how well you did...
Copy the multi line comment below and put it at the top of your program. Put in a mark for each criteria and a comment if necessary.
/* SELF ASSESSMENT
   1. Did I use appropriate CONSTANTS instead of numbers within the code? 
       Mark out of 5:
   2. Did I use easy-to-understand, meaningful CONSTANT names?
       Mark out of 5:
   3. Did I format the CONSTANT names properly (in UPPERCASE)?
       Mark out of 5:
   4. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names?
       Mark out of 10:
   5. Did I format the variable names properly (in lowerCamelCase)?
       Mark out of 10:
   6. Did I indent the code appropriately?
       Mark out of 10:
   7. Did I use an appropriate for loop to test all possibilities?  There should be only one.
       Mark out of 20: 
   8. Did I correctly check if people alive today were or could be alive in a year that is the square of their age in that year.
       Mark out of 30: 
   9. How well did I complete this self-assessment?
       Mark out of 5:
   Total Mark out of 100 (Add all the previous marks):
