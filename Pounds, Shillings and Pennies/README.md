Write a program which takes in amounts of old Sterling pounds, shillings and pennies and converts it to modern pounds and pennies.

Assume:
1 old penny = 67 new pennies (due to inflation!)
1 old shilling = 12 old pennies
1 old pound = 20 old shillings
1 new pound = 100 new pennies
 
e.g. the output should look appear like one of the lines below:
  1 old pound, 0 old shilling and 0 old pence = £160.80
 0 old pound, 1 old shilling and 0 old pence = £8.04
 0 old pound, 0 old shilling and 1 old pence = £0.67
 3 old pound, 2 old shilling and 5 old pence = £501.83
Just before you submit your program you need to do a self-assessment exercise to evaluate how well you did...
Copy the multi line comment below and put it at the top of your program.  Put in a mark for each criteria and a comment if necessary.
/*  SELF ASSESSMENT
   1. Did I use appropriate CONSTANTS instead of numbers within the code?
       Mark out of 10:   
   2. Did I use easy-to-understand, meaningful CONSTANT names?
       Mark out of 5:  
    3. Did I format the CONSTANT names properly (in UPPERCASE)?
       Mark out of 5:  
   4. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names?
       Mark out of 10:  
   5. Did I format the variable names properly (in lowerCamelCase)?
       Mark out of 10:  
   6. Did I indent the code appropriately?
       Mark out of 10:  
   7. Did I read the input correctly from the user using (an) appropriate question(s)?
       Mark out of 10:  
   8. Did I compute the answer correctly for all cases?
       Mark out of 20:  
   9. Did I output the correct answer in the correct format (as shown in the examples)?
       Mark out of 10:  
   10. How well did I complete this self-assessment?
       Mark out of 10:  
   Total Mark out of 100 (Add all the previous marks):
