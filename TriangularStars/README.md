A “star number”, s, is a number defined by the formula:  s = 6n(n-1) + 1     where n is the index of the star number.  Thus the star numbers are:   1, 13, 37, 73, 121, 181, 253, …

A “triangle number”, t, is the sum of the numbers from 1 to n:   t = 1 + 2 + … + (n-1) + n.  Thus the triangle numbers are:  1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, 136, 153, 171, 190, 210, 231, 253, …

Write a Java application that produces a list of all the values of type int that are simultaneously star numbers and triangle numbers.  As part of this problem you must write and use the following functions:

An isStarNumber() routine which determines if the passed number is a star number or not.
A determineStarNumber() function which returns the star number of a passed index (i.e. value of n) OR a determineTriangleNumber() function which returns the triangle number for a passed index (i.e. value of n)

Just before you submit your program you need to do a self-assessment exercise to evaluate how well you did... 

Copy the multi line comment below and put it at the top of your program. Put in a mark and a comment for each criterion (even if you have given yourself full marks, otherwise one mark will be deducted per criterion that is missing this information).

/* SELF ASSESSMENT

 1. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names formatted properly (in lowerCamelCase)?

        Mark out of 5:         Comment:

 2. Did I indent the code appropriately?

        Mark out of 5:         Comment:

 3. Did I write the determineStarNumber or determineTriangleNumber function correctly (parameters, return type and function body) and invoke it correctly?

       Mark out of 20:          Comment:

 4. Did I write the isStarNumber function correctly (parameters, return type and function body) and invoke it correctly?

       Mark out of 20:          Comment:

 5. Did I calculate and/or check triangle numbers correctly?

       Mark out of 15:          Comment:

 6. Did I loop through all possibilities in the program using system defined constants to determine when to stop?

       Mark out of 10:          Comment:

 7. Does my program compute and print all the correct triangular star numbers?

       Mark out of 20:        Comment:

 8. How well did I complete this self-assessment?
