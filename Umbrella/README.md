Write a program which determines if the user should bring an umbrella when they go out (if it looks like it might rain or is raining) and if so whether they should put it up (if it is raining).


Just before you submit your program you need to do a self-assessment exercise to evaluate how well you did...
Copy the multi line comment below and put it at the top of your program. Put in a mark for each criteria and a comment if necessary.
/* SELF ASSESSMENT
   1. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names? 
       Mark out of 10:
   2. Did I format the variable names properly (in lowerCamelCase)?
       Mark out of 10:
   3. Did I indent the code appropriately?
       Mark out of 10:
   4. Did I read the input correctly from the user using appropriate questions?
       Mark out of 20:
   5. Did I use an appropriate (i.e. not more than necessary) series of if statements?
       Mark out of 30:
   6. Did I output the correct answer for each possibility in an easy to read format?
       Mark out of 15:
   7. How well did I complete this self-assessment?
       Mark out of 5:
   Total Mark out of 100 (Add all the previous marks):
