Alternative version to TwelveDaysOfChristmas assignmnent, using Switch statements.

Write a program to produce the lyrics (all 12 verses) of the Twelve Days of Christmas. This is a cumulative song as each verse is build on top of the previous verses. You must

have a loop for the verses, build up each of the verses within a loop (or switch statement), use at least one switch statement in your solution, only write the lines of text (or constants representing them) from the song once in your program (e.g. you cannot have more than one statement in the entire program which prints out "my true love sent to me")... Sample output.

On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me: a Partridge in a Pear Tree. On the second day of Christmas my true love sent to me: 2 Turtle Doves and a Partridge in a Pear Tree. On the third day of Christmas my true love sent to me: 3 French Hens, 2 Turtle Doves and a Partridge in a Pear Tree ... Just before you submit your program you need to do a self-assessment exercise to evaluate how well you did... Copy the multi line comment below and put it at the top of your program. Put in a mark and a comment for each criterion (even if you have given yourself full marks, otherwise one mark will be deducted per criterion that is missing this information).
