Write a program to maintain a list of the high scores obtained in a game.  The program should first ask the user how many scores they want to maintain and then repeatedly accept new scores from the user and should add the score to the list of high scores (in the appropriate position) if it is higher than any of the existing high scores.  You must include the following functions:

initialiseHighScores () which sets all high scores to zero.
printHighScores() which prints the high scores in the format: “The high scores are 345, 300, 234”, for all exisiting high scores in the list (remember that sometimes it won’t be full).
higherThan() which takes the high scores and a new score and returns whether the passed score is higher than any of those in the high score list.
insertScore() which takes the current high score list  and a new score and updates it by inserting the new score at the appropriate position in the list


Just before you submit your program you need to do a self-assessment exercise to evaluate how well you did... 

Copy the multi line comment below and put it at the top of your program. Put in a mark and a comment for each criterion (even if you have given yourself full marks, otherwise one mark will be deducted per criterion that is missing this information).

/* SELF ASSESSMENT

 1. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names formatted properly (in lowerCamelCase)?

        Mark out of 5:  

 2. Did I indent the code appropriately?

        Mark out of 5: 

 3. Did I write the initialiseHighScores function correctly (parameters, return type and function body) and invoke it correctly?

       Mark out of 15:  

 4. Did I write the printHighScores function correctly (parameters, return type and function body) and invoke it correctly?

       Mark out of 15:  

 5. Did I write the higherThan function correctly (parameters, return type and function body) and invoke it correctly?

       Mark out of 15:  

 6. Did I write the insertScore function correctly (parameters, return type and function body) and invoke it correctly?

       Mark out of 20:  

 7. Did I write the main function body correctly (first asking for the number of scores to be maintained and then repeatedly asking for scores)?

       Mark out of 20:  

 8. How well did I complete this self-assessment?

        Mark out of 5:

 Total Mark out of 100 (Add all the previous marks):
