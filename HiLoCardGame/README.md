USING A WHILE OR A DO-WHILE LOOP write a program which allows the user to play the Hi-Lo Card game:


The Hi-Lo card game is one where the user is presented with an initial card (2 â€“ 10, Jack, Queen, King, or Ace) and has to guess that the next card with be Higher (Hi), Lower (Lo) or Equal to the current card.
They must guess successfully 4 times in a row in order to win.
Sample input/output (input is highlighted in red).
The card is a 3
Do you think the next card will be higher, lower or equal? higher
The card is a Ace
Do you think the next card will be higher, lower or equal? lower
The card is a 9
Do you think the next card will be higher, lower or equal? lower
The card is a 7
Do you think the next card will be higher, lower or equal? higher
The card is a King
Congratulations.  You got them all correct.
Just before you submit your program you need to do a self-assessment exercise to evaluate how well you did...
Copy the multi line comment below and put it at the top of your program. Put in a mark and a comment for each criterion (even if you have given yourself full marks, otherwise one mark will be deducted per criterion that is missing this information).
/* SELF ASSESSMENT
