Write a program which comput the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person.  The BMI is computed by dividing the weight of a person (in kgs) by the square of the height of the person in meters.

Notes:
Your program will have input, computation and output.
You can use either the command line or dialog boxes for input and output.

LAB INSTRUCTIONS.

First try to get one (or both) of the provided sample programs compiled and executed in Ecilpse.
Only then try to get the BMI program running.
Use the demonstrators.  Ask them questions if you are stuck.
If everything is working correctly then try to make your programs fail.  Look closely at what happens.
